## Closures aka anonymous functions

Go supports anonymous functions, which can form closures. Anonymous functions are useful when you want to define a function inline without having to name it.

Functions in Go are first class citizens so it can be:
- passed as parameters
- created as types
- assigned as values to variables
- called anonymously
