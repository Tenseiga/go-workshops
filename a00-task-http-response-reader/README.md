# Task

MVP:

- Write HTTP response reader from given sources
- You can implement it with channels.
- Push results in JSON format to os.Stdout

Homework for ambitious ones:

- Do it with given interval (e.g. 10 seconds)
- Pass last results back through WWW REST JSON API (e.g. localhost:8080/statuses)
