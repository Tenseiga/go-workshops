## HTTP library

Package http provides HTTP client and server implementations.

HTTP is one of fundamental lib in programming. Go has implemented very powerful HTTP primitives which allows creation of full-fledged HTTP powered servers.

Info: there is no routing in stdlib so you need to implement your own or use third party libraries (Gorilla mux, Gin, Echo are ones who can help you)
