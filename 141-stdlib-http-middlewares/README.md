## HTTP Middlewares

Go is using the term `middleware`, but each language/framework calls the concept differently. `NodeJS` and `Rails` calls it `middleware`. In the `Java EE` (i.e. Java Servlet), itâ€™s called `filters`. `C#` calls it `delegate handlers`.

Essentially, the middleware **performs some specific function** on the HTTP request or response **at a specific stage in the HTTP pipeline** before or after the user defined controller. Middleware is a design pattern to eloquently add cross cutting concerns like logging, handling authentication, or gzip compression without having many code contact points.
